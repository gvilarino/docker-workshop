# Docker workshop

A simple `docker` workshop for anyone who want's to learn how to use docker effectively in their day-to-day dev work.

This repo attempts to drive you through the fundamentals and into some advanced topics like `docker-compose` or docker's swarm mode.

This is, of course, a continuous work in progress; feel free to propose changes and spread the word.

Get started in the [`0-docker-basics`](https://github.com/gvilarino/docker-workshop/tree/master/0-docker-basics) section.
