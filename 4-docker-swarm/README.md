# Docker swarm

Docker's swarm mode allows you to go all serious about large-scale, highly available docker environments. It basically lets you handle a cluster of machines as a single docker daemon, with automatic failover, container scheduling, routing and tons of other goodies.

This last section will walk you through creating a simple swarm cluster and the basic concepts. Do be noted that understanding docker swarm to its fullest is *way* beyond the scope of this guide. In any case, let's cut to the chase, shall we?

## Get some nodes

In order to have a docker swarm going, you'll need a machine cluster, for which you'll need machines. The quickest, coolest way is by using [`play-with-docker`](http://play-with-docker.com/) to try it online. If you'd rather try it locally, you'll need [`docker-machine`](https://docs.docker.com/machine/) and [`Virtualbox`](https://www.virtualbox.org/). If you're running `Docker for Mac` or `Docker for Windows` you probably already have it installed; `Linux` users should get `docker-machine` separately.

The main difference is how long it'll take you to have the swarm ready. If you're just trying it out, the online route is probably what you want. If you'd like your swarm to be persistent or try some extra stuff you'll want to use the local approach (it may get resource intensive).

Pick your poison and choose one of the following:

#### Online sandbox

Browse to [`play-with-docker`](http://play-with-docker.com/) and create three nodes with the "+ ADD NEW INSTANCE" button.

Skip to the [next section](https://github.com/gvilarino/docker-workshop/tree/master/4-docker-swarm#get-swarmin).

#### Local swarm

Make sure you have `docker-machine` installed by doing:

```
docker-machine --version
```

Start by creating the cluster master node:

```
docker-machine create -d virtualbox manager
```

That created a manager node. You can `ssh` into it if you like:

```
docker-machine ssh manager
```

Cool, innit? Now `exit` and create some worker nodes:

```
docker-machine create -d virtualbox worker1
docker-machine create -d virtualbox worker2
```

Now you'll need to talk to the docker daemon in the manager node. You may `ssh` into it, but let's do it from the outside, which is more similar to what you'd do in a real-world scenario.

The quick way to do this is by doing:

```
eval $(docker-machine env manager)
```

This command set some env vars that tells your docker client where and how to find the docker daemon it's supposed to communicate with. Check which ones by doing:

```
env | grep DOCKER
```

Note that every command you tell docker to run will actually run on the manager's docker daemon, so if you do `docker images` or `docker ps` you won't see the stuff you've been working on during this workshop since you aren't talking to your local daemon anymore.

If you want to revert to talking to your local daemon either open a new terminal or `unset` those env vars.

### Get swarmin'

Let's get this swarm started. Grab a hold of the manager node host IP. In `play-with-docker` you'll see it in node's terminal prompt; if running locally with `docker-machine` it's usually `192.168.99.100`

```
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <manager node's ip>
```

This set the node's docker daemon to swarm mode and outputs the `swarm join` command you'll need for other nodes to join this swarm. Copy it to your clipboard; you'll need it soon.

Verify the swarm status by doing.

```
docker info
```

You can see under `Swarm` the swarm state.

See the swarm nodes with:

```
docker node ls
```

Now let's make both worker nodes join the swarm cluster: run the command you just copied into your clipboard inside each of the worker nodes (if running locally, `docker-machine ssh` into both workers and `exit` back to your terminal)

See now that your swarm is 3 nodes big:

```
docker node ls
```

You now have a 3-node working swarm cluster ðŸ˜Ž

## Services

Just like `docker-compose` works with the concept of services, so does docker swarm. Let's create a very simple service that pings `docker.com`

```
docker service create --name pinger --replicas 1 alpine ping docker.com
```

See some info about the service by doing

```
docker service inspect --pretty pinger
```

Check its status by doing:

```
docker service ps pinger
```

You can see in which node it's running. Now let's scale the service by getting more replicas of it (each replica is a container):

```
docker service scale pinger=5
```

Now if you `docker service ps pinger` you'll see in which nodes the new replicas are running.

Now you have a full-fledged local docker swarm.

Let's kill one of the worker nodes and see how docker re-schedules its containers: in `play-with-docker` just hit the delete button in any of the worker nodes. If running locally just `docker-machine rm worker2`

Now `docker service ps pinger` repeatedly to see how some of the pop up in the other nodes automatically. How cool is that?

You now have a resilient, distributed application running in a docker swarm cluster âœ¨

## Final words

These are just the docker basics, you'll learn a lot more by addressing real-life scenarios, so get hackin'

Hopefully, this repo will encourage you to [do some more research on your own](https://docs.docker.com) and make docker part of your development toolkit and prod pipelines.

Please feel free to update/fix anything that you see improvable in this repo, and if you liked it spread the word.

Thanks for reading ðŸ™‡
